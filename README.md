# Capstone_Project
This is a text-based adventure that showcases the skills I've learned in a Python development course. 
It utilizes dictionaries, if loops, while loops, and functions to take the user through a mystery story. 
Players will move through the Blackwood mansion, talking to guests and searching for clues that eventually lead to the final puzzle. 
Once the final puzzle is completed, the user will input their guess as to who the culprit is. 
All inputed answers will be guided as how to answer (Yes or no) 

## Installation
There is no other program to install in addition to Python 3

## Gameplay
There are opportunities to end the game without truly finishing the main storyline. Some are funny, some aren't. Regardless, if you hit one of these, you'll have to restart. They're moreso there so I could practice with exiting a code early, failing a task or puzzle, etc. 
The suspects all have unique dialogue and provide insight on why they're suspects. Major clues are in each room.
